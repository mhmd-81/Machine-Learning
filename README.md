# Machine Learning Simplified
Welcome to the "Machine Learning Simplified" repository!
# Overview

Machine learning is a dynamic and high-demand field in our world today. This repository aims to provide a user-friendly approach to understanding complex concepts in machine learning. Whether you are a beginner or looking to enhance your knowledge, this resource is designed to make the learning process more accessible.
# Contents

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Explore the fundamental steps of data cleaning and preprocessing in machine learning projects.

Random Data Generation: Learn how to generate random data and test mathematical formulas for effective experimentation.

CSV File Import: Understand the process of importing data from CSV files, an essential skill for real-world machine learning projects.

Outlier Detection: Discover a streamlined method to identify and analyze outlier data points in your datasets.

# How to Use

Feel free to explore the provided notebooks and code snippets to enhance your understanding of machine learning fundamentals. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!


# datasets folder
there is a folder called datasets  if you open  it up you an see some datasets for trainin g that I've gathered for you to use. Ive to say that files are in .CSV format because its easier to use and the moste commen format in ML community.

# codes folder
there is also a folder called codes so  you can find the codes of the datasets folder in it but sometimes maybe there will be files that are not related to the datasets folder for thoes I'll guid you how to use that.

# articles folder
there is also a folder called articles that I've tried to teach some basics and useful methods of ML. feel free to use them and upgrade yourself.
Happy learning! ðŸš€
