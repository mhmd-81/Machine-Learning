# California_Housing_prices_

## first discussion 

its been a while I'm thinking to make a powerfull project from zero to hero for my repo.
so I decided to work on this project and show you how a complete model looks like.
and make you familiar wit different parts of a complete project.
so grab your coffee and  LETS GO!!! ☕ 💪🏿


## About this project
this project is going to make a ML model to guess california house prices ... 
as you  know we will have a big dataset of california houses  with their features that we'll see in data_exploration
then we are going to do some preprocessing and feature engineering on our data to achieve a clean and useful dataset
afterall we will use diffrent models of sklearn on our dataset to see which one is better.
then its time to deploy the model and use it in  our web app.

## data_loading
in this section we are oing to load data from directory and load it.
after that we need to load it by pandas.
for now its what we are going to do in our project.

## data_visualizing
so after loading data we need to see what kind of data do we have so as we saw that we have longitude and latitude in our dataset so we can make a scatter plot to see a map of the city then we can use alpha to see where the houses are gathered.
